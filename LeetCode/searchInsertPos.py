# Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

# You may assume no duplicates in the array.

# Example 1:

# Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
# Output: 2


class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums, target):
        return sorted(nums + [target]).index(target)
